INSTRUCTIONS
---------
Each .psd file has a green labeled layer called "YOUR TEXT SMART OBJECT". Right-click on that layer and select "Edit Contents".
A new window will open and you'll be able to replace the default text with yours. Then you just need to save and if you go back to the original psd you'll find the text effect applied on your text.


COLOR EDITING
---------
Each effect is composed by multiple layers, organized in folders by the same layer-styles.
So if you want to change the color (for example to the “Effect” folder) of a text effect
you should select one of the layers, edit his color by the later-style option panel and then copy the layer stlye and paste it on the other layers of the folder.
